Installation
============


To install the latest PyPI release, simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pacman


Alternatively, you can install the latest version of ``pacman`` from source. This is useful if you wish to contribute to the development of ``pacman``, or if you need features that have not yet been made available in a stable release:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone http://github.com/chufansuki/pacman
    cd pacman
    pip install -e .
