Distribution optimizing for communication and agents hosting costs

for AAMAS 2018

We use an interger linear program to find and optimal distribution of
computation over the agents.
The objective is a weighted sum of the communication costs and the hosting
costs.

Communication cost depends on the message size between two computations in
the computation graph and on a route cost factor that characterize the cost of
sending a message over a route between two agents.

Note: this distribution methods honors the agent's capacity constraints but
does no use the distribution hints (if some are given, they are just ignored).
