OILP-CGDP : Optimal ILB-based distribution for Computation Graph

This is a generic distribution method, which works for any computation graph (constraint
graph, factor graph, etc.).

This method optimizes the distribution for:
* hosting costs
* communication cost, made of communication load (betwwen two computation)
  and route costs (between two agents)
A weighted sum is used to aggregate these two objectives.

Agents's capacities are used as hard constraints for the distribution.
