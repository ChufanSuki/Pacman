OILP-SECP-CGDP : Optimal ILP-based SECP Computation Graph Distribution

Distribution of a computation graph for a SECP, when using a constraint graph based DCOP
algorithm

This distribution method only takes into account communication loads between computations,
not hosting nor route cost.

This distribution method is designed for SECP and makes the following assumptions on
the DCOP (which are always satisfied if the SECP has been generated using
'pacman generate' command):
* variables that represent an actuator are assigned to an agent, with an hosting cost of 0
* all agent must have a capacity attribute
