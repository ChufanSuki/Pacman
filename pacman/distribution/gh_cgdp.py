GH-CGDP : Greedy Heuristic for Computation Graph distribution

Distribution heuristic based on hosting costs and communication cost,
while respecting agents' capacity.

Greedy algorithm:
* place computation with highest footprint first
* select agent with enough capacity left and smallest aggregated hosting
  and communication costs, according to the communication that have already been placed.


This means that the first computations (with biggest footprint) are mostly placed based
on their hosting cost, as most other computations are not distributed yet and we cannot
evaluate their communication cost.
